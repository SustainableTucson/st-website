                        We have ten, maybe fifteen years to decarbonize our activities, our city, and the world, 
                        repairing our damage to habitable places, and slowing the accelerating cascade of extinctions. 
                        We can achieve these goals if each major decision from now on eliminates fossil fuels from 
                        our daily habits. That means that household appliances, heating, water heating, cooking, and 
                        our long-term transportation purchases from here on out need to be powered by electricity, not 
                        gas, and that before mid-century we're supplying them almost exclusively with cleanly produced 
                        electrical power. This will triple our electricity use, but the elimination of fossil fuels 
                        and their inherent inefficiencies means overall energy consumption will decline.
